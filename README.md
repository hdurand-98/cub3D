# cub3D

A quite hard project about graphic programming in C. The goal here is to use raycasting to simulate a 3D environment like in the early 3D FPS games such as Wolfenstein. 

# How to use

cd mlx_linux -> make
cd .. -> make and execute ./cub3D conf

Where conf is a configuration with a .cub extension with a certain format, an example configuration file named "test.cub" is provided.
